# A Zombie Shooter Game

### About
A game with no name. For now its goal is very simply to shoot zombies chasing after you. The game has several advantages, like high quality bullet ballistics and geocentric camera rotation relative to the player. I'd like to make something similar to S.T.A.L.K.E.R., with open locations, quests, cooperative mode and so on. It may take a lot of time and effort. I'll do it as best I can, because as I've only been programming about an year.
